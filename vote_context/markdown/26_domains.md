## Summery

The Cardano Foundation wants the community to commit to supporting their effort to acquire the rights to the `.ada` and `.cardano` domain names. They say nothing about sharing revenue from the sale of such domains with the treasury.

## Conclusion

It would be inappropriate to grant the Cardano Foundation more control over the ecosystem. These domain names would serve as appeals to authority. If they were under the control of the Foundation, it would give them influence over who is perceived as credible and who is not. I am voting against this. 

Signed,
William Doyle
