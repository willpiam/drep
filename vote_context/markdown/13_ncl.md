## Summary 

Proposes to set a 300 million ADA Net Change Limit for the time period between approximatly June 8th 2025 and June 3rd 2026. 

## Considerations

- Lower than the current net change limit
- Longer time period than the current net change limit
- together these mean less money per day can be spent
