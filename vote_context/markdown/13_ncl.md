## Summary 

Proposes setting a 300 million ADA Net Change Limit for the period from approximately June 8, 2025, to June 3, 2026. 

## Considerations

- Lower than the current Net Change Limit
- Covers a longer period than the current Net Change Limit
- Together, this means less money can be spent per day
- We should try to avoid pausing all withdrawals due to not having an NCL, as was the case earlier this year. 

## Statement

I agree that we should define an NCL that extends into the next year to avoid a period without an NCL. However, I believe this NCL is too low for this period given our current situation. 

Should this proposal be enacted, the Intersect budget of ₳275M would leave only ₳25M for anything else the dReps choose to fund until June 3, 2026. With the current NCL of ₳350M, the dReps would remain in control of ₳75M.

The dReps, as a collective, need to develop resource allocation skills. The only way to achieve this is by giving them a sufficiently large budget that allows for a few mistakes. 

Signed,
William Doyle
