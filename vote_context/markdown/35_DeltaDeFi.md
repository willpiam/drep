I was convinced to vote against this proposal by Jaromir Tesar in this post: https://x.com/JaromirTesar/status/2008124514148798841

Specifically this paragraph: 

```
However, giving a single DEX team more than 2M ADA to develop without demonstrable results is too much in my opinion. At this stage, I would prefer the team to focus on attracting users and liquidity with what already exists (MVP), rather than requesting a large new budget to continue building.
```

I don't see the demand for this product. Our blockspace is rarely full and DeltaDefi does not have a large number of users. The proposal is intresting and I hope they are successful, but this is not a priority at this time.
