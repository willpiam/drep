## Objection

1. This draft contains grammatical changes as well as substantive changes. Making both types of changes in a single revision makes it difficult to identify and isolate the substantive changes. 
2. Changes to the markdown styles are unwarranted and make it difficult to identify the substantive changes in the diff document. Seriously, you've made the "list of changes" almost useless. 
3. I do not agree that we should remove the budget requirements. The current budget process grants us a much needed discovery period.
4. Definitions are unwarranted.
5. Minor grammatical changes are unwarranted
6. Some of the supporting documents attached to this proposal are not available 
7. Removing the non-binding expectations is unwarrented. 

## Summary

I'm not going to approve this or any other constitutional revision with this many changes. 1770 additions is too much. That should be a single digit number.
