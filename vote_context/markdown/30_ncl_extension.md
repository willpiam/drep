## Summary

Extends the time period covered by the 2025 NCL (Net Change Limit) by eight epochs. This does not increase the amount of ada that can be spent according to the NCL but only extends the period of time governed by it.

## Conclusion

Thanks to the good dog HOSKY for noticing this. I see no issue with this proposal. This proposal is also important to ensure the Critical Integrations budget and withdrawal can proceed without issue. I am voting in favour of this proposal. 

Signed,
William Doyle
