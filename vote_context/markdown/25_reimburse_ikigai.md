## Summary

Last year some people got together and made an info action basically saying “Cardano is pretty cool, Charles is pretty cool”, but they used a fancy Japanese word, Ikigai. It was a special moment and one of the first governance actions.

We were all still learning, and some technical mistake was made, resulting in the group being unable to withdraw their 100k ADA deposit.

In this info action, the proposer suggests withdrawing 103k ADA to compensate for the lost ADA and opportunity.

## Conclusion

This is very reasonable. It was part of Cardano’s growing pains, and this loss should not be borne by one person alone. They helped us and, in the process, took some damage. It is only right that we stand with them. That being said, I will only vote to approve the actual withdrawal once I have seen proof that the funds are indeed going to the account/person who supplied the funds for the deposit.

This should not be seen as a precedent for addressing future stuck deposits. This case is unique in that it was one of the very first governance actions.

Signed,
William Doyle
