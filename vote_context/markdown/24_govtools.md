## Conclusion

While I really like many of the features proposed in this budget (script-based DReps, multiple votes per transaction, group proposers, CoSponsor integration), I just don't see the need for costs to be this high. All of these features would be nice, but none of them are real priorities right now.

Signed,
William Doyle
