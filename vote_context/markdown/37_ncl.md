## Summary

Proposes a net change limit (NCL) of 350M ada to cover the period spanning February 13, 2026 to July 3, 2027. This is approximately 505 days, giving a maximum average daily burn rate of 693,069 ada per day.

## Conclusion

Seems like a reasonable NCL for this period of time. It's approximately in line with previous values. I'm voting yes on this NCL proposal.
