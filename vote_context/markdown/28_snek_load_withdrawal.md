## Summary

This proposal is a treasury withdrawal in line with the budget proposed in [gov_action1jr84r96lnsvu9yd6c0jhxe9gj5r7vnd2pgkntc6klplxdpyzz4tqqc9uldx](https://cardanoscan.io/govAction/gov_action1jr84r96lnsvu9yd6c0jhxe9gj5r7vnd2pgkntc6klplxdpyzz4tqqc9uldx) which I voted against. It seeks to withdraw a 5M ada loan to fund an initiative to list the SNEK memecoin on centralized exchanges. [Here is a link to my response to that budget.](https://github.com/willpiam/drep/blob/master/vote_context/markdown/20_snek_loan.md)


## Conclusion

When this budget was proposed I said I wouldn't bet treasury funds on the long-term success of a memecoin. I still don't think this is a wise use of funds. I am voting against this proposal. 

Signed,
William Doyle
