## Statement

The deposit lending protocol has the potential to generate transactions on the L1 while making governance more accessible. However, the budget seems high. I particularly struggle with the infrastructure costs of 200k Ada for only six months of operation. That seems significantly higher than it should be. I am abstaining from voting on this project's budget due to having mixed feelings about it. 

Signed,
William Doyle
