## Summary

This proposal seeks a 5M ada loan to fund an initiative to list the SNEK memecoin on centralized exchanges. 

## Details

- Snek is a memecoin and Cardano native asset
- The SNEK asset id is asset108xu02ckwrfc8qs9d97mgyh4kn8gdu9w8f5sxk

## Conclusion

Ultimately this proposal is asking us to bet on the long-term success of a memecoin. I wouldn't do that if it were my own money and I'm certainly not going to do it with treasury funds.
