## Considerations

- The governance action does not contain any explanation of Christina's motivations.
- Having done a little bit of preliminary research on Christina, it is clear she has been involved in the Cardano community for quite some time.
- I've reached out to Christina over Twitter via a direct message but have yet to receive a response.
- I want more individuals on the CC instead of multisigs.

## Statement

Christina appears to be qualified for the role. I would have liked more explanation of her values and motivations. I prefer individuals on the CC because it makes for more direct personal responsibility. I am voting to make Christina a member of the CC because I want the CC to be mostly composed of individuals who will take direct responsibility for their actions with little insulation from consequences such as removal. I also want to avoid over-distilling the committee. Individuals come with unique perspectives and values, but large committees average out to mediocrity.
