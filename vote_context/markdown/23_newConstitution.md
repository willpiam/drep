## Summery

The proposer of this governance action has provided their own summary for us.

1. Cardano Constitution v2.3 removes non-binding expectations, the Budget Info Action mechanism, and mandatory CC conduct rules, streamlining governance.
2. It adds clear definitions, enforces immutability of proposal documents, and applies treasury audit/accountability safeguards to all withdrawals.
3. Community review of v2.0 had 86.23% DRep participation, and v2.3 incorporates feedback and improvements, addressing prior concerns to reinforce legitimacy and broad input.


## Concerns

- The term "Ada user" was chosen in Argentina because it was intended to include those who had not taken custody of their own keys.  
- *"For as long as they wish, while honoring their freedom to take another path."* ... This sounds lame.  
- We don't need definitions; some ambiguity is acceptable.  
- This is a significant rewrite of the constitution, and it has not undergone sufficient community exposure or review.  
- It is not clear that we should remove the budget info action mechanism.  
- We should not approve large changes to the constitution in a single action; each individual change should be proposed as its own revision.  


## Conclusion

For the reasons listed above, I am voting against this constitutional revision. 

A lot of effort went into reaching the constitution as it exists today. If you want to propose minor individual changes, I will be much more open to them than I am to the large revisions you have submitted thus far.  


Signed,
William Doyle
