## Summary

Requests 778,000 ADA to drive adoption in Oceania through...

- hackathons
- meetups
- workshops
- community mapping (a list of Oceanic Cardano community members)
- marketing 

## Conclusion

I am skeptical that this proposal can have much meaningful impact. These hackathons, meetups, and workshops are likely to only attract existing community members while doing very little to grow global awareness of Cardano.
