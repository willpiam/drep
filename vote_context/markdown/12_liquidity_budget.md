## Summary 

Requesting â‚³50M to seed liquidity in DeFi protocols on Cardano.

- Funds would be managed by a four-of-seven multisig with the following members

    - Linda Roland         
    - Darren Camas         
    - Nick Schaub, Ph.D.  
    - Giorgio Zinetti    
    - Massimo Morini, Ph.D.
    - Darlington Wleh

- The seventh member has not yet been selected. 
- 15% of monthly interest is returned to the treasury
- 85% of interest remains in the "protocol"
- 3.33% of the Cardano Treasury (~50M ADA) to be used to mint fiat-backed stablecoins over 12 months. Up to 35% can remain in ADA for pairing in DEXs.
- Each committee member receives $14,000/month or an annual salary of $168,000
- Up to $50,000/month for operational costs
- $600,000 per year in operational costs
- operational costs + committee salary = $148,000/month or $1,776,000 annually
- Organization: Legal entity (preferably non-profit) will be formed to manage funds.

## Considerations

- I do not see why we should pay each committee member $168,000 annually
- Given that there will be seven committee members, we would be paying $1,176,000 to the committee annually. 
- GovTools could not verify the metadata
- *Organization: Legal entity (preferably non-profit) will be formed to manage funds.* This sentence gives the sense that critical decisions have not yet been made and important research has not yet been done. 
- The lack of a seventh member indicates that the plans for this project have not been finalized. 
- The malformed metadata suggests a lack of attention to detail
- Lacks details about the legal framework employed

## Statement

 A lack of stablecoin liquidity has been identified as an area in need of improvement in the Cardano DeFi ecosystem. Thus, it may be wise to invest some portion of the treasury directly as stablecoin liquidity. Unfortunately, I do not think the management solution outlined in this proposal is strong enough in its current form to be implemented. 

 I encourage the team to refine the concept further and resubmit this proposal. 

Signed,
William Doyle
