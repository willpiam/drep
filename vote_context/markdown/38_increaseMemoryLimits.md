## Summary

Intersect's Parameter Committee proposes the first of two Parameter Update governance actions. The following change is proposed together in this rationale, but will require two separate, linked governance actions as per guardrail MTEU-M-04.


1. increase Plutus script memory unit limits per transaction by 25% to allow greater flexibility for DApp developers.
2. increase Plutus script memory unit limits per block by 25% to remain consistent with the current block memory limits.

## Conclusion

As a developer, I've run into these limits before. I'm confident the network can handle the increased load. Increasing these parameters means Cardano has more resources to sell. I'm voting yes.
