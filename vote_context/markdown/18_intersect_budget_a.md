## Withdraw ₳130,903 for Lucid Evolution Maintenance administered by Intersect

Lucid Evolution is critical infrastructure and this is a reasonable price. Having used Lucid Evolution I can attest to it being a great tool which could absolutely benefit from some investment.

## Withdraw ₳3,000,000 for High-yield RWA Asset for Cardano: Tokenized Real Estate

I've never liked this proposal. I don't like the idea of using treasury funds to invest in real estate. The current real estate market is unnaturally high. Also, the amount of trust this product demands is unacceptable. Real world assets are still not mature technology. While I'm open to the idea of funding RWA tooling development, I'm uncomfortable with the idea of investing treasury funds into RWAs made with the currently available technology. Not only do I think it's a bad time to invest in real estate, I think it's a bad idea to invest in immature tokenization products.

## Cardano Global Listing Expansion - Powered by Snek

I just don't feel good about this one. 

## Intersect Budget

We still need Intersect

## CDN

I don't see the need for this. Why does the cardano ecosystem need its own CDN?

## SNEK thing

I just don't know. Thus I will abstain. I'm not sure about funding a meme coin project, but at the same time the issue this proposal aims to address has been a serious topic of discussion within the Cardano community for a long time. 

## Unveiling the First Unified Global Events Marketing Strategy for Cardano

I don't think this is what Cardano needs right now. 

## Cant remember (fix later) 

I just don't see the value here. I do believe in advertising but I don't think this approach has significant potential.

## Unveiling the First Unified Global Events Marketing Strategy for Cardano

## Quadratic voting 

Considered voting NO because I don't like the idea of quadratic voting OR catalyst (I think catalyst proposals should instead be submitted to the dreps). But the team seems cracked and I'd like to give them a shot. They've already had their budget approved. Innovation in the governance space should be encouraged. I am voting YES.  

## Market making

Its a big request and I don't think its necessary 

## Default

I'm defaulting to voting yes because there is some degree of consensus already achieved on each of these. So unless I have a significant issue with one of these proposals I will be voting yes on it.

### Option 2

No strong opinion. Defaulting to YES
