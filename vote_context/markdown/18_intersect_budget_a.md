## Withdraw â‚³130,903 for Lucid Evolution Maintenance administered by Intersect

Lucid Evolution is critical infrastructure and this is a reasonable price. Having used Lucid Evolution I can attest to it being a great tool which could absolutely benefit from some investment.

## Default

I'm defaulting to voting yes because there is some degree of consensus already achieved on each of these. So unless I have a significant issue with one of these proposals I will be voting yes on it.
