## Summary

This proposal requests 778,000 ADA to drive adoption in Oceania through:

- Hackathons
- Meetups
- Workshops
- Community mapping (a directory of Cardano community members in Oceania)
- Marketing

## Conclusion

I am skeptical that this proposal will have meaningful impact. These hackathons, meetups, and workshops are likely to attract mostly existing community members and do little to raise awareness of Cardano. Therefore, I am voting against this proposal.

Signed,
William Doyle
