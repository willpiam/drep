## Summary

The net change limit is ₳300M for epochs 613–713, or from February 13, 2026, to July 3, 2027. This is a period of 505 days, with an average burn rate of ₳594,059.

## Conclusion

I voted in favor of the ₳350M budget, which did not pass. This budget is ₳50M less than that, so I see no reason to vote against it.
