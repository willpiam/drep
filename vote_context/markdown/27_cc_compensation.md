## Summery

Withdraw 1M ada to compensate the Constitutional Committee for the next year of service. Five of the seven seats are seeking compensation. Each of those five will receive 200K ada. 

## Conclusion

The constitutional committee plays an important role in the governance of Cardano. To ensure that we can continue to rely on their contributions, it is appropriate to compensate the committee for their efforts. I find the amount proposed to be quite reasonable.

Signed,
William Doyle
