### Set 2025 Net Change Limit of 300M ADA, 2026 Net Change Limit of 250M ADA

I see this proposal as making two main points. The first is that we should set a minimal NCL early and optionally increase it later. The second is that we should set these values at 300M ₳ for 2025 and 250M ₳ for 2026.

I agree with both of these suggestions.
