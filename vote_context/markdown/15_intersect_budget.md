## Summary 

This proposal seeks â‚³275M to fund 39 sub-proposals. These sub-proposals were selected through the Ekklesia platform, which allowed dReps to vote off-chain on what to include in this governance action. 

*"Projects that received over 50% support by stake from participating DReps, and named Intersect as their Administrator, have been included in this Budget Info Action."*

This budget constitutes over 78% of the current NCL.

## Statement

Despite wanting to avoid an omnibus budget, and despite having concerns about some of the budget items, I am voting YES on this governance action. The majority of these funds are going to important work which should not be delayed given this critical period in Cardano's development. 

Next year we should try to avoid an omnibus budget. To make this feasible, we will need to build an effective tool to enable governance action deposits to be crowdsourced. 

Signed,
William Doyle
