## Summary 

This proposal seeks ₳275M to fund 39 sub-proposals. These sub-proposals were selected through the Ekklesia platform which allowed dReps to vote off-chain on what to include in this governance action. 

*"Projects that received over 50% support by stake from participating DReps, and named Intersect as their Administrator, have been included in this Budget Info Action."*

This budget constitutes over 78% of current the NCL.

## Statement

Dispite having concerns about some of the budget items I am voting YES on this governance action. The majority of these funds are going to important work.
