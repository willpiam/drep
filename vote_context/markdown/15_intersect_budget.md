## Summary 

This proposal seeks ₳275M to fund 39 sub-proposals. These sub-proposals were selected through the Ekklesia platform which allowed dReps to vote off-chain on what to include in this governance action. 

*"Projects that received over 50% support by stake from participating DReps, and named Intersect as their Administrator, have been included in this Budget Info Action."*

This budget constitutes over 78% of current the NCL.

## Criticisms

### Catalyst
**₳69,459,000**

We should use the dRep mechanisum to allocate these funds instead of Catalyst. The dReps need to practice selecting which budgets to fund. Catalyst robs the dReps of this opertunity for practice. 

### High-yield RWA Asset for Cardano : Tokenized Real Estate

**₳3,000,000**

blah blah blah...

### Complement Catalyst: Extended Quadratic Funding—Zero Operational Costs

**₳1,500,000**

We don't need another Catalyst. 

### Cardano Ecosystem Pavilions at Exhibitions

**₳1,119,333**

blah blah blah...
