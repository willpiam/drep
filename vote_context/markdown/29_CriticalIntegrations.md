## Summary

A budget of 70M ada to onboard critical infrastructure including 

- tier-one stablecoins
- institutional digital asset custody and wallet infrastructure
- on-chain analytics platforms
- cross-chain bridges
- pricing oracles

Parties involved

- IOG
- The Cardano Foundation
- Emergo
- The Midnight Foundation
- Intersect

Additional notes:

- The project will follow a milestone-based funding structure. Intersect will receive the funds and administer this budget. 
- A high-level budget breakdown is planned to be included in the subsequent Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action following this Budget Info Action. However, due to confidentiality obligations applied by most integration partners, the breakdown will be limited in granularity.
- If the allocated budget is not used at the end of the 24-month period, all remaining funds will be returned to the Cardano Treasury.
-  It is currently not envisioned that the smart contract framework deployed earlier this year will be fully utilized, as this will likely result in disclosure of integration costs, which are typically confidential and protected by non-disclosure agreements.


## Conclusion
