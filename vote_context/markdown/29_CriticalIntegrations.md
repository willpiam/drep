## Summary

A budget of 70M ada to onboard critical infrastructure including 

- tier-one stablecoins
- institutional digital asset custody and wallet infrastructure
- on-chain analytics platforms
- cross-chain bridges
- pricing oracles

Parties involved

- IOG
- The Cardano Foundation
- Emergo
- The Midnight Foundation
- Intersect

Additional notes:

- The project will follow a milestone-based funding structure. Intersect will receive the funds and administer this budget. 
- A high-level budget breakdown is planned to be included in the subsequent Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action following this Budget Info Action. However, due to confidentiality obligations applied by most integration partners, the breakdown will be limited in granularity.
- If the allocated budget is not used at the end of the 24-month period, all remaining funds will be returned to the Cardano Treasury.
-  It is currently not envisioned that the smart contract framework deployed earlier this year will be fully utilized, as this will likely result in disclosure of integration costs, which are typically confidential and protected by non-disclosure agreements.

The proposal justifies itself well in the following excerpt:

*Despite being a top-10 blockchain by market cap, Cardano’s Total Value Locked (TVL) as of November 25th, 2025 remains around $191.860.000 (Source: Defillama.com), which is still far below comparable ecosystems that maintain several billion dollars in DeFi usage. This gap highlights Cardano’s limited market reach and the absence of the core primitives that other networks treat as standard utilities. Without scaling these key components, Cardano risks falling further behind in attracting dApps, liquidity, institutional partners, and large-scale integrations such as tier-one stablecoins.*

## Conclusion

While Cardano is number one in terms of technology, design, and security, we have thus far struggled with mainstream adoption. Very few CNTs (Cardano Native Tokens) are listed on top exchanges, and we have not attracted the depth of stablecoin liquidity that other chains enjoy. We need to increase demand for our blockspace. If we can’t do that, what’s the point of Leios? Why bother scaling if nobody wants to use the product? We clearly need to get traffic up.

I have always been motivated by the long-term success of the Cardano blockchain. I believe the world of today and tomorrow needs Cardano. But a blockchain is dependent on aligned incentives. If we cannot drive demand for our blockspace, the people who produce that blockspace will not have an incentive to continue doing so. The security of the network directly depends on there being substantial demand for blockspace. Cardano needs users.

The critical infrastructure outlined in this proposal is exactly what Cardano needs right now.

It is encouraging to see the three founding entities involved in this proposal. I’m also pleased to see the involvement of the Midnight Foundation, as I believe Midnight can contribute massively to achieving the outlined goals. I am similarly pleased to see Intersect involved in a very appropriate capacity.

All in all, this is a very promising and mature proposal. I am voting in support of it.

Signed,
William Doyle
