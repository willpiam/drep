It is important to remember that the NCL itself does not dictate how much will be spent in a year, but rather only how much *can be* spent that year.
The DReps will still have an opportunity to reject treasury withdrawals as they arise.

While the proposed amount of â‚³350M is a tad high for my liking, it is not so high as to justify stalling the budget process.

I am voting YES on this governance action.

Signed,
William Doyle
