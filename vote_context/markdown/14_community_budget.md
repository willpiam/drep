## Summary 

The Intersect proposal took place off chain using a service called "Ekklesia" to collect votes from dReps and decide which budget items should be included in its omnibus budget. The authors of this proposal express concerns regarding the legitimacy of the Intersect proposal.

This proposal requests ₳7,568,810 and aims to fund seven high quality projects. 

## Statement

Each of the listed budget items is high quality and should receive funding. I see no reason not to support this budget. 

Signed,
William Doyle
