    "comment": "I see this proposal as making two main points. The first is that we should set a minimal NCL early and optionally increase it later. The second is that we should set these values at 300M ₳ for 2025 and 250M ₳ for 2026.\n\nI agree with both of these suggestions.\n\nSetting the lowest NCL we can all agree on allows us to immediately unlock and deploy the portion of treasury funds that has broad support, rather than waiting for consensus on a higher number. This gives the ecosystem access to funding sooner, while still leaving room to debate and potentially raise the limit later.\n\nThe two proposed values—300M ₳ and 250M ₳ for 2025 and 2026, respectively—make sense as a minimal NCL starting point because they are approximately equal to the expected treasury revenue for each year.\n \nSigned William Doyle"
