    "comment": "I agree that we should define an NCL that extends into the next year to avoid a period without an NCL. However, I believe this NCL is too low for this period given our current situation.\n\nShould this proposal be enacted, the Intersect budget of ₳275M would leave only ₳25M for anything else the dReps choose to fund until June 3, 2026. With the current NCL of ₳350M, the dReps would remain in control of ₳75M.\n\nThe dReps, as a collective, need to develop resource allocation skills. The only way to achieve this is by giving them a sufficiently large budget that allows for a few mistakes.\n\nhttps://github.com/willpiam/drep/blob/master/vote_context/markdown/13_ncl.md"
