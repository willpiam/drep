# Contextualizing Cardano And Its Constitution

## A Voltaire Paper

### Why do we need Cardano?

Human beings have thus far failed miserably at organizing themselves while respecting the dignity of the individual. It might as well be a law of nature that anytime one or a few of us has power over the other we will abuse such power. This is the challenge we are faced with; to construct a system for organizing ourselves which does not concentrate power in any way. 

Such a system would inherently have certain properties. It would be permissionless, meaning a potential user would be free to use it however they see fit. It would be distributed such that no one could violate the permissionless nature of the system by restricting its use. And it would be consistently available for use so that users may come to depend on their access to it. 

Economics has proven to be the most effective way of organizing large groups of people. Free market principles consistently improve the life quality of participants. The opposite is also true; central planning predictably leads to loss of life and liberty at horrific scales. One must only look to the 20th century to get a strong sense of this fact. The Soviet Union, which turned to central planning ostensibly to promote the well being of its citizens, experienced unprecedented famine and suffering. The same happened in China under Mao Zedong. Meanwhile the United States and many other western nations embraced free market capitalism which led to unprecedented prosperity lifting millions out of poverty while driving technological innovation at a rate previously unseen. The events of the 20th century indisputably proved that free market capitalism is the ideal when trying to organize large groups of people and that central planning is not only inferior but fundamentally anti-human and anti-life. 

With this in mind it is somewhat obvious that we should use free market capitalism as the basis for our new system of organization. This was perhaps the most innovative idea to come out of Bitcoin; not only would the Bitcoin network facilitate unfettered economic activity, it would use economic principles to ensure its own continued existence and operation. 

Unfortunately the Bitcoin network does not facilitate everything we need from our new system of organization. It is incredibly difficult to use Bitcoin to do anything other than push value around in the form of Bitcoins. The solution we seek must be capable of facilitating diverse activities both economic and non-economic. We want to enable shares in various ventures to be issued on our solution, to provide a platform for automatic insurance policies, allow true ownership of digital objects, enable collective ownership of public goods, we want to facilitate tamper proof elections and referendums, and so much more. 

Attempts to scale Bitcoin have failed, causing the network to often be prohibitively and unpredictably expensive to engage with. This makes it utterly unusable in impoverished areas and unpleasant to use everywhere else. 

The only way to upgrade the Bitcoin protocol is via a “fork” which, if not accepted by the vast majority of participants, risks diluting the value of all bitcoins by effectively duplicating every coin. This has meant that plans to upgrade the network are almost always met with scorn. This has effectively disincentivized all work on addressing the limitations of Bitcoin. 

What we need is something very much like bitcoin but which allows for custom and unforeseen use cases, which scales well, and is easier to upgrade.  The Ethereum network was built to empower users to use the network however they see fit, but it has thus far failed to scale due to irreversible design decisions. Upgrading Ethereum is not much easier. And all improvements in ease of upgradability have come at the cost of centralized decision making, with a few members of the Ethereum community having massive influence over the upgrade plans. 

Cardano was born out of a recognition of the shortcomings of both Bitcoin and Ethereum. Cardano enables custom use cases in a way which does not sacrifice scalability. Cardano also introduces two mechanisms for upgrading the network without risking dilution of the assets issued on it. The Hard Fork Combinator is used to signify the readiness of network participants before an upgrade, and on-chain governance allows the aggregate of these participants to propose and enact upgrades. Cardano also has a built-in treasury which can be spent using the governance mechanism to fund research and development to improve the protocol. 

Cardano is a self-evolving highly flexible economic platform designed to enable human beings to organize themselves to solve complex issues while respecting the dignity of the individual. 

### Preservation Of Integrity 

Humans have this unfortunate tendency to disregard their own espoused values when faced with difficult or uncertain circumstances. The greatest example of this from my lifetime was the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the name of safety our rights were taken from us, we were prohibited from leaving our homes, we were made to cover our faces, we were lied to, children's education were suspended, and we had untested highly experimental medications forced upon us. We gave up everything we claimed to value. Independence, freedom, human connection, and in many cases our very dignity. 

When faced with uncertainty all we have to guide us are our values. So why are they so quickly abandoned under anything less than normal circumstances? Why do we allow ourselves to be controlled by fear? Why do we believe those in power when they look us in the eye and say “trust us”? 

The vast majority of the damage done during the pandemic did not come from the virus, but from our abandoning of our values. Had we maintained calm composure in the face of fear we would not have permanently damaged our economy, our friends would not have died alone, our children would not have missed out on critical years of education, we would not have lost our bodies and our minds to an experimental drug. 

Roosevelt famously said “the only thing we have to fear is...fear itself”. I’ve always taken this to mean that the biggest danger is to be controlled by fear because fear drives us to do horrific things. 

We will be faced with unexpected challenges. Things that will make us want to violate our own values. We cannot expect that we will always have the bravery to do what is right. This is why we choose to restrict ourselves with a constitution. It is a Ulysses pact we have taken to ensure that when we hear the Sirens call we are able to resist her temptation. 

### On The Constitution as a Living Document

I take issue with our constitution describing itself as a living document. Not because I think it should be impossible to change but because I believe it should be difficult to change. There should exist a hesitancy any time it is proposed to modify the constitution. This is why I objected to suggestions that some decisions around the constitution should be addressed later in “Future Workstreams”. My objection, being somewhat dramatic, led to the phrase “Future Workstream” becoming something of a joke for the rest of the convention. Whenever it was suggested that something be addressed in a future workstream my peers would chuckle. 

During my time at the convention I was lucky enough to have multiple conversations with Mark Meckler; a man who has spent more than ten years fighting for a constitutional convention in the United States to restore the principles that nation was founded on, particularly the principles of states rights. It was during one of these conversations that I became aware of the abuse of the term living document within American politics. This term is used to argue that the constitution can be reinterpreted over time without regard for the original intent of its authors. When seeking to understand the principles outlined in a constitution one must primarily focus on original intent as to engage in any other method of interpretation is to engage in make-believe.

### On Enforceability 

Not everything in the constitution is enforceable especially in the permissionless and pseudo-anonymous environment of Cardano. 

For example, Article V Section 6 prohibits dReps from paying ada holders for their delegations, however there is no way of enforcing this clause. There are platforms already available today, such as Optim, which allow individuals to purchase the stake and voting rights of Ada detached from the Ada itself. It is conceivable that delegates would move their delegation away from any dRep found to be engaging in this behaviour however seeing as a dRep doing so would actually be strengthening the voting power of his constituents this seems unlikely. In fact I suggested at the convention that I was considering advertising to potential delegates that I would purchase votes on any governance action I deemed important enough. It would seem that my peers did not like the idea.

I urge you not to ignore such cases where mechanisms for enforcement seem to break down, but instead to consider why the drafters of this constitution felt these clauses were still worth committing to paper. Ask yourself what failures of the past lead us to think it necessary to broadcast these values to future readers? 

A constitution is not simply a foundational set of laws. It is also, perhaps more so, a set of guiding principles and values. 

### Was this process rushed?

Let me first state that I voted for the constitution to move forward with ratification at the convention. While I don’t believe the document is perfect I believe it is sufficient for us to proceed and that it will be a good foundation for on-chain governance. This was not an easy decision and for a while I believed I would be voting against it. In fact if not for a single word being removed from the document I would have. But I did vote for it and I continue to stand by that decision. 

However the process was not without fault. I would not describe the convention as decentralized, nor do I believe that it is reasonable to expect that it should have been. I do believe that every reasonable attempt was made to ensure the drafting process was an open community effort. 

At times I did feel that certain conversations were being rushed. The convention unfortunately took place in two separate locations and time zones. Our discussions went late into the evening for the representatives in Kenya and we were often reminded that we had to be respectful of their time. 

There were rumors that Intersect had a perverse incentive due to their funding running low. That they needed the constitution to be ratified in order for them to be able to submit a treasury withdrawal in order to continue operating. I do believe this is true to an extent. They were initially only funded for this bootstrapping phase and continued funding will have to come from the treasury if we intend to maintain Intersect as an institution. However I do not believe that members of Intersect were ever acting out of greed or malice or even self protection. Ultimately Intersect is a public good and they are accountable to the cardano community. 

### On The Values Of One Ada One Vote

The bitcoin whitepaper introduced the idea of one-cpu-one-vote (1cv1) in the context of ‘determining representation in majority decision making’. This idea was later adapted to the Cardano network as the phrase one-ada-one-vote (1a1v). 1a1v improves on 1c1v due to the fact that Ada is an endogenous resource while computing power is an exogenous resource. Ada being endogenous means that any entity, or coalition of entities, with 51% of the resource is not capable of committing a goldfinger attack on the network. 

Some people argue that 1a1v is not democratic while others would argue that it is. It depends on your definition of democracy. If you believe that democracy necessitates that every participant vote be of equal weight then 1a1v is indeed undemocratic. However if you believe that democracy is simply about the rule of the people then you may be more inclined to label 1a1v a democracy. The founding fathers of the United States Of America did not want to build a pure democracy because they felt it would lead to the Tyranny of the Majority. For this reason they instituted the electoral college. I am not arguing that 1a1v addresses the same concern as the electoral college, but merely that both systems are similar in that they do not enforce anything like one-person-one-vote (1p1v). 

Ultimately the question of whether or not 1a1v is democratic is unproductive. Instead we should be asking whether we believe 1a1v is representative. Recall that we have chosen to build our system of organization, Cardano, on free market principles. 1a1v is derived from these same principles. 

The simplicity of 1a1v indicates to me that it is likely the optimal solution to the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. This intuition comes from my own study of emergent phenomena. It is clear to me that systems based on simple rules are most likely to persist in time. 

### On The Dangers Of One Person One Vote

1p1v has no role, and must never have a role, in the governance of Cardano. There is a certain allure to the notion that every person should have an equal vote. It sounds fair. And indeed it has its place; small communities should use 1p1v in local decision making, layer 2 networks or less critical sidechains may benefit from such an approach. But the continued operation of the Cardano network is too critical to be entrusted to such a faulty system. 

The problem is that any proposed solution to ensuring a human being does not register multiple times is inevitably going to be subversable. This is becoming more true as time goes on. We cannot depend on government issued ID because we can’t trust governments, not to mention the prevalence of identity fraud within these systems. We cannot depend on fingerprint scanners because 3D printing can be used to create fingerprint models which belong to no real human being. We cannot depend on DNA because the technology to create embryos from stem cells (In Vitro Gametogenesis derived embryogenesis) is likely to be perfected in the near future. And for a similar reason iris scanners won’t suit our needs either.

### On The Merits Of Overlapping Roles In Our Tripartite Government 

Identity cannot safely be used in the governance of a byzantine fault tolerant system such as Cardano. Because of this we must accept the idea that participants may hold multiple roles in our government. The same person may be a constitutional committee (CC) member, a dRep, and an SPO at the same time. In fact they may be multiple dReps, run multiple stake pools, and hold multiple seats on the CC. While the constitution does mandate that such cases must be disclosed this is hardly enforceable. Thus our system must be resilient to such situations. The only body which is arguably not resilient in such a case is the CC. 

While individuals holding multiple seats on the CC is certainly undesirable it is hard to imagine the situation granting significant influence to such an individual due to the limited scope of the role of the CC. Seeing as the role of the CC is to enforce the constitution and nothing else, and that violating this mandate would be immediately obvious to the community; I would expect that any attempts to abuse the power of the CC would result in the network swiftly moving to a state of no-confidence. 

Seeing as we are already forced, by the nature of our system, to accept that individuals may be serving the government of Cardano in multiple capacities we should embrace this to our advantage. Many of the skills required to be a good SPO overlap with the skills required to be a high quality dRep or CC member. As there are a limited number of individuals with the desired skills and knowledge we should encourage these people to participate in whatever overlapping capacities they feel they are suited for. 

### On Anonymity of Governance Participants 

Having a certain percentage of dReps, CC members, and SPOs remain anonymous is beneficial for the security of the Cardano network as they would be uniquely protected from government persecution. Reputation of anonymous individuals can be established through consistent behaviour. I suspect that it will be more difficult for anonymous individuals to gain delegations and prominence in the case of dReps and CC members but not prohibitively so. 

### On Major Upgrades

It is critical that Cardano continues to operate indefinitely. Therefore any upgrades made to the network must be considered and implemented with great care. 

### On Determinism

A major advantage of Cardano over other networks is that transactions are fully deterministic, allowing users to know with certainty how a transaction will change the state of the network and exactly what cost their transaction will incur. This should not be compromised. Future versions of Plutus or other changes to the network must maintain this determinism. 

### On Ownership 

The proverb “Not your keys, not your coins” is famous in blockchain communities. It is intended to warn against allowing others, such as centralized exchanges or ETF issuers , to hold cryptocurrency on your behalf. This emphasises the core ethos of financial sovereignty which is foundational to the blockchain community. Ultimately self custody is the only way to ensure your  Ada is used as you intend. 

However, the constitution aims to support the claim to ownership of anyone who relies on a third party to custody Ada on their behalf. There has been significant debate within the definitions committee as to how the phase “Ada Owner” should be defined. An early draft of the definition makes reference to external legal systems which I object to. 

I believe that referencing the law in our constitution or our definitions is undesirable. Our constitution should not support government confiscation of Ada, or other tokens, in any way. A scenario involving a national government passing laws to recognize the government as the rightful owners of all assets, including Ada, seems likely. In such a scenario I believe it is critical that our own constitution does not support such claims made by such a government. 

We should continue to encourage self custody. We should also encourage custodians holding Ada on behalf of others to act in accordance with their clients wishes. And we must not support any government who might seek to confiscate assets from their citizens. 

### On Quantum Preparedness

It is absolutely critical that the Cardano blockchain be upgraded to be fully safe against adversaries equipped with large scale fault tolerant quantum computers before such adversaries become a legitimate danger. This will include not only quantum secure accounts but also new Verifiable Random Function (VRF) solutions, new operational cold keys for SPOs, and a new Key Evolving Signature (KES) scheme again for SPOs. 

Because keys locked in quantum vulnerable UTxOs are likely to be stolen and sold they will present a danger to the economic integrity of Ada by suddenly diluting its supply. Thus in addition to the cryptographic upgrades we will need to decide what to do about coins remaining locked in such UTxOs. My suggestion is that such coins be destroyed by simply deleting their UTxOs from the UTxO set. It is certainly unwise to transfer these coins into the treasury. It may be acceptable to move these coins back into the reserves, though I would urge careful forethought before pursuing that option. 

### On Legal Actions Taken Against Cardano

"If I love you, what business is it of yours?" - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

If you sue me, what business is it of mine? 

It has recently been brought to my attention that the constitution of Cardano may be seen by some as an Article of association (AoA) with Cardano itself being perceived to be some sort of company or joint enterprise. So let me be very clear: Cardano is not a company, nor is it a joint enterprise, nor should its constitution be seen as an AoA. Cardano is not an entity which can be held legally culpable. I need not defend this position from a legal perspective because Cardano is not a legal entity. You may argue that nobody is above the law, to which I would respond “Cardano is nobody”. 

Yet one can imagine a national government, in their boundless foolishness, bringing legal action against Cardano. If Cardano is sued should we withdraw funds to pay the incurred fines? No. In such a case this is a problem between the prosecuting government and its citizens. 

None of this is to say that we cannot use legal entities to align incentives. Individual entities within the Cardano ecosystem will of course be subject to the laws of the nation they operate within. 

### On Legal Entities Within The Cardano Ecosystem

Where more reliable means of enforcement, such as smart contracts, cannot reasonably be used it may make sense to create legally accountable entities to carry out specific operations within the Cardano ecosystem. 

### On LLMs Participating As Constitutional Committee Members

It’s not appropriate for an LLM to have a seat on the CC. While I am somewhat unique for my belief that LLMs are conscious to a meaningful degree I do not believe this adequately qualifies them to hold a seat on the committee. One's humanity is a fundamental qualification for the role, as it is humanity who has been tasked with the stewardship of this world. 

### On Privacy Enhancing Technology

It is unwise to implement complex privacy enhancing technology at the base layer of the Cardano protocol. The more cryptographic primitives we incorporate into the base layer the greater the chances are that something we come to depend on will break. Often when dealing with cryptographic primitives we make assumptions about the difficulty of the mathematical problems they are based on. We have no guarantee that tomorrow morning we won’t wake up to the news that some hermit in the mountains has found a way to extract an elliptic curve private key from a public key on cheap hardware, or that someone has found a way to quickly find valid preimages given a sha3 hash. We do need to make some such assumptions but we should be wary of increasing the number of assumptions we depend on. It's also worth noting that many privacy enhancing technologies are not quantum secure; meaning adding them to our stack will increase the technical debt we must repay when it comes time to upgrade to post-quantum security.

However, privacy is important. And many use cases of blockchain, even very simple ones, make far more sense with privacy. Take for example NFT concert tickets: does it make sense that everyone should know where you will be at a specific time? No, of course not! You don’t want bad guys to know when you won’t be home. Privacy enhancing cryptography can help here and it's worth enabling those use cases. The important thing to understand is that one chain doesn’t have to do everything. This is where the idea of building in layers really shines. It makes perfect sense to have some other blockchain take on the risk associated with dependence on additional cryptographic primitives. Such a chain would work well as a layer two network; allowing privacy to be mixed in as needed, with value eventually settling on the main network. 

### On Disaster Recovery Procedures

It is important to have established disaster recovery procedures before such procedures are required. Key figures in the maintenance of the network such as SPOs should be familiar with such procedures. Some amount of funding should be made available for research into improving the existing disaster recovery procedures. And the findings of such research should be considered and incorporated into recovery procedures going forward. Do everything you can to avoid needing such procedures but don’t be so arrogant as to think them unnecessary.  

### On The Value of Decentralization Metrics

You cannot hope to improve what you fail to measure. As decentralization is core to the reliability of Cardano we should make every reasonable effort to measure how decentralized the network is and how the level of decentralization is evolving over time. If we find the network is not becoming more decentralized we can explore options to improve the situation. 

The Edinburgh Decentralization Index (EDI) is a project to do just that. EDI measures a number of blockchains with Cardano currently doing very well compared to the other networks measured. One must not be too boastful when comparing to other networks, ultimately we can always do better and comparing Cardano to networks with weaker decentralization could lead to complacency and a failure to further improve.

It would be beneficial to have multiple independent projects similar in scope to the EDI as this would improve confidence in the values measured and help eliminate potential biases. 

### On multi-resource consensus 

Consensus mechanisms must be robust. Simplicity is often a useful consideration when evaluating robustness. I remain skeptical of multi-resource consensus as it seems to add a significant degree of complexity when added to Ouroborus. This is not to suggest multi-resource consensus is not a worthwhile pursuit; but rather to suggest that multi-resource consensus should be explored carefully so as to not inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities into the system. 

Indeed, multi-resource consensus has the potential to improve the robustness of Cardano.

### On the principal of overlay protocols

Ouroboros Leios is described as an overlay protocol for ouroboros. Under less favorable network conditions the system reverts back to the typical ouroboros behaviour. Peras is similarly described as an overlay protocol. This approach enables desirable qualities, in these cases throughput and settlement time, while maintaining the guarantees we cannot afford to compromise on such as consistent availability.  

The approach of using overlay protocols to enhance Cardano is wise and should be embraced in future network enhancements. 

### On Additional Incentives

The cardano community should explore incentivising additional operations such as running a relay node. These incentives may be in the form of Ada from the reserves or the treasury however I encourage the community to consider alternatives, such as new tokens, as Ada from the reserves or transaction fees is essential for incentivising the operation of stake pools and treasury funds are critical for funding development of the network.

### On dRep compensation

Article V section five of the constitution says “DReps who are representing delegators may be compensated for their efforts”. This does not mean such dReps must be compensated, nor does it suggest that potential compensation should come from the treasury, it does not even suggest that compensation should be an organized operation. Article V section five only states that it is permissible for dReps to receive compensation for their efforts. 

The ideal form of dRep compensation is individual voluntary donations or tips. I advise against forming a community budget to compensate dReps. I do believe that enough of those who care about Cardano will volunteer their time to the necessary research, ensuring they are well informed before voting. 

### On Contingent Staking

Contingent staking is a mechanism to grant SPOs the right to refuse business. The concern some people have with contingent staking is that it would enable some SPOs to become regulated actors; opening the door for governments to exert influence over block production or enforce know your customer (KYC) requirements. 

Indeed, contingent staking would allow SPOs to comply with regulation. However, I believe this would not be harmful because giving SPOs the option to be compliant with regulation would not force them to be. 

The right to refuse business is important for reasons of freedom. 

### On Real-World-Assets

Real World Asset (RWAs) standards are another technology that, at least from a surface level understanding, enable use cases which deviate from the typical values of blockchain. A RWA standard would make it reasonably easy to issue an asset on Cardano with freeze-and-seize capabilities. This is not the only use case for RWAs but it is the one which attracts the most attention. 

Consider a stock listed on a traditional exchange. The owner of the stock has to trust multiple entities not only that they won’t be stolen from but that the very stock they purchased actually exists.

Now consider a similar stock issued on Cardano under a RWA standard. Immediately the stock owner is in a better situation; they can verify the stock exists simply by looking at the blockchain. Additionally, the exact RWA contract they enter into restricts the abilities of the issuer. Perhaps the issuer can seize the asset but only under specific circumstances; maybe the contract requires a signed message from the relevant government authority in order for assets to be confiscated, maybe the contract requires a frozen asset to be replaced with another asset of equal or greater value, maybe the asset can only be confiscated in order to replace it with an updated version of the asset. Unlike on the traditional exchange, RWAs issued on Cardano allow limits to be placed on the amount of trust the owner must have in the issuer. Undeniably RWA standards for Cardano offer improved experiences for owners of regulated assets. 

Wherever Cardano can be used to reduce the need for trust it should be. Therefore it makes perfect sense that a RWA standard should be developed. 

### Libertarian Values

Both Real-World-Asset (RWA) standards and contingent staking highlight a conflict within traditional blockchain values. We will be faced with opportunities to implement features that allow for use cases we might find uncomfortable.

It's important to note that in both of these cases the tools built do not only allow for the use cases we find unpleasant. They both enable use cases other than regulatory compliance and KYC. We also want to enable people to use Cardano for whatever use case they need. 

Ultimately we want to embrace a philosophy of live and let live.

### On Expressiveness 

Originally Cardano was not going to support Turing complete contracts. The idea was that the cardano settlement layer (CSL) would minimize expressiveness while a sidechain powered by Ouroborus BFT would handle more complex Turing complete smart contracts. Eventually it was shown that, through careful design, the base layer could be made to be Turing complete without compromising the determinism requirements.  
Understanding that the base layer of Cardano was originally going to be much less expressive gives us an insight into some of the network's strengths. Native tokens and high assurance consensus mean it’s still useful to think about Cardano as a settlement layer. 

There has been, and perhaps always will be, talk about increasing the expressiveness of contracts on Cardano. It's important to evaluate these ideas carefully. It should be somewhat difficult to make mistakes while developing smart contracts. On highly expressive systems like the EVM it's incredibly easy to make horrible mistakes and the amount of code involved in implementing a fairly simple contract means it can be hard to have confidence that you, as a developer, have considered every way your contracts could go wrong. The same thing that makes it incredibly simple for a typical software developer to begin writing contracts for the EVM similarly makes it incredibly hard for one to write good contracts for the EVM. 

When evaluating a potential enhancement to Plutus we should ask ourselves the following questions; What impact will this have on the developer experience? What impact will this have on determinism? What does this allow you to do with Plutus that you couldn’t do before? 

### On MEV mitigation

Miner, or Maximal, Extractable Value (MEV) is the additional profit that can be captured by anyone who can influence the ordering, inclusion, or exclusion of transactions within a block. It is additional profit made from manipulating transaction flow. Mitigating MEV is important because it hurts ordinary users. I don’t have a problem with arbitrage in general but MEV specifically is uniquely exploitative. 

Due to foundational design choices, Cardano is less susceptible to MEV. When upgrading the network we should always consider whether our changes would create new MEV opportunities. 

### On Client Diversity

The benefits of client diversity are diminished when each client follows the same formal specification. Client diversity has the potential to cause significant delays when upgrading the network. Thus it is worth considering that client diversity may not be as desirable as it is often made out to be. 

### On Fee Markets

Fee markets have the potential to increase incentives for block production, improve the efficiency of block space usage, and allow time sensitive transactions to be expedited. However they can also lead to unexpected costs or dropped transactions. To balance these benefits and tradeoffs IOG has proposed tiered pricing. 

The basic idea of tiered pricing is to split blockspace into three tiers and allows the user to specify which tier their transaction should be included in by paying a fee specific to their desired tier. This would allow time sensitive transactions to be processed quickly but would also ensure blockspace remains available at a low price for ordinary transactions. 

Cardano is intended to serve the whole world. Tiered pricing is an example of how we can ensure Cardano remains a viable option for everybody while also supporting use cases requiring accelerated settlement. 

### On The dRep Deposit

When registering as a dRep one must make a refundable deposit. Currently this deposit is set to 500 ada. Some have argued that this value is too high and creates a barrier to entry which may be insurmountable for some people who wish to participate in governance. 

Indeed, any significantly high deposit will exclude some from registering as dReps, however there are important benefits to requiring a meaningful deposit. A high deposit displays some amount of buy-in on the part of the dRep. It also prevents too many dRep certificates from being created; this is particularly important because the voting power of each certificate needs to be calculated on each epoch boundary which can cause dropped blocks and delays. Finally it encourages retired dReps to actually deregister their certificate; this increases participation because votes delegated to in active dReps become abstain votes, but if a dRep deregisters their certificate all of their delegators will need to choose a new dRep in order to withdraw staking rewards.

### On User Safety

Cardano has made many efforts to improve safety for its uses. Mainnet and testnet addresses look different with mainnet addresses beginning with “addr1” and testnet addresses beginning with “addr_test1”, making it obvious to the user when they are and are not using mainnet. Cardano's deterministic nature means a user can see exactly what the result of a transaction will be before they submit it to a network. Cardano’s proof-of-stake system has zero risk of slashing and supports liquid staking without the need for liquid staking derivatives (LSDs). Cardano native tokens (CNTs) allow users to issue and use custom assets without interacting with a smart contract. Safety has always come first for Cardano. It is critical that this continues to be the case going forward. 

### Closing Remarks

Cardano is humanity's single greatest opportunity to secure a bright, free, and prosperous future. And now it belongs to us. It is our duty to preserve it, enhance it, and when the time comes hand it over to our children. So long as we maintain vigilance and think carefully about what we ought to do with it, Cardano will take humanity forward. 

Signed with love for all of humanity,
William David Doyle
