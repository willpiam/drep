# The Agenda Of DREP $computerman

## Promote and maintain the long term viability of Cardano
I believe that Cardano is of great benefit to humanity. *add more*

## Respect the monetary policy of Ada
Ada (â‚³) has a maximum supply of 45 billion. There will never be more than 45 billion ada created. No governance action shall ever change this.

## Transaction Censorship
No governance action shall ever enable the censorship of transactions on the Cardano blockchain.

## Build strong bridges with other blockchains and ecosystems

## Cardano as a settlement layer should be cautious about adding cryptographic dependencies

## Ensure Block production does not centralize
