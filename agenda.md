# The Agenda Of DREP $wildoy

## Promote and maintain the long term viability of Cardano 
I beleve that Cardano is of great benefit to humanity. *add more*

## Respect the monetary policy of Ada
Ada (â‚³) has a maximum supply of 45 billion. There will never be more than 45 billion ada created. No governance action shall ever change this. 

## Keep Cardano as a single resourse blockchain
While multiresourse blockchains are intresting and useful, it is part of the social contract of Cardano that Ada alone will serve as the basis of consensus on Cardano. This does not prohibit using other resourses may be incentivised using new tokens, but these incentives should not be part of the consensus mechanism. Summery: Minator is cool but was not a part of the original social contract of Cardano and the Ada holders.
