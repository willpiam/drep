# The Agenda Of DREP $wildoy

## Promote and maintain the long term viability of Cardano
I believe that Cardano is of great benefit to humanity. *add more*

## Respect the monetary policy of Ada
Ada (â‚³) has a maximum supply of 45 billion. There will never be more than 45 billion ada created. No governance action shall ever change this.

## Keep Cardano as a single resource blockchain
While multiresource blockchains are interesting and useful, it is part of the social contract of Cardano that Ada alone will serve as the decentralizing resources of consensus. Additional resources may be created to incentivise other mechanisms in the ecosystem, such as a token to incentivise storing the chain, but should not be incorporated directly into the consensus of Cardano. Summery: Minator is cool but was not a part of the original social contract of Cardano and the Ada holders.

## Recognize the value of advertising
I recognize the value of advertising and am open minded to funding advertising campaigns with treasury funds.

## Transaction Censorship
No governance action shall ever enable the censorship of transactions on the Cardano blockchain.

## Build strong bridges with other blockchains and ecosystems

## Cardano as a settlement layer should be cautious about adding cryptographic dependencies

## Ensure Block production does not centralize
While other networks are embracing the idea that centralized block production is fine assuming decentralized block verification. Cardano should not follow this path. Cardano must keep block production decentralized.
